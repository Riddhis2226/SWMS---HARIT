## 🗺️ **Roadmap: Smart Waste Management App (Flutter + Firebase Ecosystem)**

---

### ✅ **Phase 1: Setup & Preparation**

* [ ] **Install Tools**

  * ✅ Install **Flutter SDK** and **Dart SDK**
  * ✅ Install **Android Studio**

    * Add Flutter & Dart plugins
    * Set up emulator or use real Android device
  * ✅ Install **Firebase CLI** (for emulator and deployment)
  * ✅ Create a **Firebase Project** in Firebase Console
  * ✅ (Optional) Sign up for **Firebase Studio** and **Google AI Studio**

* [ ] **Project Initialization**

  * ✅ Create a new Flutter project in Android Studio
  * ✅ Use `flutterfire configure` to connect your Flutter app to Firebase
  * ✅ Generate `firebase_options.dart` using FlutterFire CLI

---

### 🔐 **Phase 2: Authentication System**

* [ ] Use **Firebase Authentication**

  * ✅ Enable Email/Password sign-in
  * ✅ Set up **role-based access** (Citizen, Municipality, Driver)

    * Add `role` field in Firestore user document

* [ ] Flutter Implementation

  * ✅ Create login/signup screens using `firebase_auth`
  * ✅ Redirect users to correct dashboard based on their role

---

### 🗂️ **Phase 3: Database & Storage Structure**

* [ ] **Firebase Firestore Setup**

  * ✅ Collections:

    * `/users` → user profiles with roles
    * `/complaints` → submitted complaints (images, location, type, status)
    * `/assignments` → assigned tasks to drivers
  * ✅ Structure complaint document:

    ```json
    {
      "userId": "abc123",
      "location": { "lat": 12.34, "lng": 56.78 },
      "imageUrl": "path/to/image.jpg",
      "category": "Plastic",
      "status": "Pending",
      "createdAt": Timestamp,
      "assignedTo": "driver456"
    }
    ```

* [ ] **Firebase Storage**

  * ✅ Store uploaded waste images
  * ✅ Create folders like `/waste_images/{complaintId}.jpg`

---

### 📲 **Phase 4: Flutter Front-End Modules**

#### 👤 Citizen Module

  * ✅ Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
  * ✅ Use topic-based or user-specific notifications

    * e.g., `/topics/driver_{city}` or tokens per user

* [ ] **Automations with Firebase Cloud Functions**

  * ✅ Auto-send notification on new complaint or status change
  * ✅ Auto-assign drivers based on:

    * Proximity (using Maps Distance Matrix API)
    * Load (task count)

---

### 💡 **Phase 6: Smart Features & AI Integration (Future Scope)**

#### 🧠 Google AI Studio (when you're ready to scale up)

* [ ] **Image Classification**

  * ✅ Train AI model to detect waste type/severity
  * ✅ Use TensorFlow, Vertex AI or upload to Google AI Studio
  * ✅ Call model from Flutter via REST API

* [ ] **Chatbot Assistant**

  * ✅ Use Gemini or Dialogflow
  * ✅ Add simple in-app help chatbot for citizens

* [ ] **Smart Routing**

  * ✅ Use Google Maps or Mapbox Optimization APIs
  * ✅ Optimize driver routes based on multiple stops and priorities

---

### 🧪 **Phase 7: Testing**

* [ ] Use **Firebase Emulator Suite** to test:

  * Auth
  * Firestore
  * Functions
  * Notifications
* [ ] Test on real Android devices (location, camera, image upload)
* [ ] Flutter Testing:

  * ✅ Unit tests (logic)
  * ✅ Widget tests (UI components)
  * ✅ Integration tests (flows)

---

### 🚀 **Phase 8: Deployment**

* [ ] **Deploy to Play Store**
